## 🎬 Usage

### Step 1: Add Videos

Place your video files in the channel's directory:

```bash
videos/
├── channel1/
│   ├── video1.mp4
│   ├── video2.mp4
│   └── video3.mp4
└── channel2/
    ├── video1.mp4
    └── video2.mp4
```

**Supported formats:** MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, FLV, WMV

### Step 2: Add Titles

Go to the Dashboard, select a channel, and click ‘Edit Titles.’ You’ll see two modes: Random and Fixed.

- Random: Titles are picked randomly for each video. Enter one title per line if you choose this mode.

- Fixed: Each video gets a specific title. Use the following format:

```bash
Simple Title | video1.mp4
Test Title | video2.mp4
Funny Video | video3.mp4
```

In Fixed mode, you must type the video file name along with its corresponding title.

### Step 3: Schedule Setup

You need to set the time period during which your video should be uploaded. Times use the 24-hour format. For example, if you set 15:00 to 15:30, your video will be uploaded sometime within that time window.

### Step 4: Set Up Automation

Manually add to crontab:

```bash
# 🕒 3 times daily (9 AM, 3 PM, 9 PM)
0 9,15,21 * * * /usr/bin/php /aytsu/publish.php
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

📍 "No Refresh Token" Error

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
2. Remove your app's permissions
3. Re-authorize the channel through the dashboard

📍 Videos Not Uploading

**Check:**
- ✅ Channel is enabled in dashboard
- ✅ Current time is within upload schedule
- ✅ Minimum hours between uploads has passed
- ✅ Videos exist in the channel directory
- ✅ Titles exists and is not empty

📍 Token Expired Issues

**If tokens expire too quickly:** Make sure your app is **"Published"** in Google Cloud Console

---

## 📊 Performance Tips

### Optimize Upload Schedules
- **Stagger upload times** between channels (avoid same windows)
- **Limit concurrent uploads** to 2-3 channels at once

### Manage API Quota
YouTube Data API has daily quotas. Each upload costs about **1600 quota units**.

**Default quota:** 10,000 units/day = ~6 uploads/day

**To increase quota:**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Request quota increase
3. Explain your use case
